Got it âœ… â€” to build a billing system around this **Hospital Billable Services Outline**, youâ€™ll need to design flows that handle **service capture â†’ charge generation â†’ payment processing â†’ reconciliation â†’ reporting**.

Hereâ€™s a structured outline of the **flows required**:

---

# ðŸ“Š Billing System Flows for Hospital Services

## 1. **Patient Onboarding & Registration Flow**

- **Trigger:** New patient arrives at hospital.
- **Steps:**

  1. Patient biodata collected.
  2. Registration card issued â†’ fee generated.
  3. Administrative/medical record creation fee logged.
  4. Invoice generated â†’ Payment collected at Cash Office (or recorded against account for credit facilities).
  5. Receipt issued + patient ID linked to billing account.

---

## 2. **Consultation Billing Flow**

- **Trigger:** Patient books consultation.
- **Steps:**

  1. Service request captured (outpatient/general or specialist).
  2. Vitals check & clerking logged as billable service.
  3. Invoice auto-updated in patient account.
  4. Payment collected (pre-consultation or post depending on policy).
  5. Receipt generated.

---

## 3. **Diagnostics & Laboratory Billing Flow**

- **Trigger:** Physician orders tests.
- **Steps:**

  1. Lab request entered into system.
  2. Each test mapped to billable codes & fees.
  3. Pro-forma invoice generated (patient pays upfront before test unless on credit).
  4. Cash Office/payment confirmation unlocks lab processing.
  5. Charges added to patientâ€™s account (with results linked to record).

---

## 4. **Pharmacy Billing Flow**

- **Trigger:** Physician prescribes medication.
- **Steps:**

  1. Prescription entered in pharmacy system.
  2. System calculates drug cost + dispensing fee.
  3. Invoice updated.
  4. Patient pays before collection (except for inpatients billed on discharge).
  5. Pharmacy confirms payment â†’ releases medication.

---

## 5. **Inpatient Admission & Ward Billing Flow**

- **Trigger:** Patient admitted.
- **Steps:**

  2. Bed type selected â†’ daily accommodation charges begin (auto accrual per day).
  3. Nursing care, physician rounds, medical procedures logged daily.
  4. Care plan/assessment entries generate incremental charges.
  5. System maintains running inpatient bill (visible to Cash Office & patient).
  6. On discharge:

     - System consolidates daily charges + final procedures + discharge fee.
     - Invoice finalized.
     - Payment settled (deposit reconciled).

---

## 6. **Observation Unit Billing Flow**

- **Trigger:** Patient placed in observation ward.
- **Steps:**

  1. Observation registration logged.
  2. Observation unit fee posted.
  3. Periodic assessments & equipment usage auto-billed.
  4. Invoice generated & payable before discharge.

---

## 7. **Surgical Services Billing Flow**

  1. Pre-op tests billed & paid.
  2. Operating room booking logs OR utilization fee.
  3. Surgery fee + anesthesia services calculated.
  4. Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) charges accrued.
  5. If inpatient stay required â†’ link to ward billing flow.
  6. Final consolidated invoice at discharge.

---

## 8. **Follow-up & Post-Discharge Billing Flow**

- **Trigger:** Patient books follow-up.
- **Steps:**

  1. Appointment scheduling fee logged.
  2. Post-discharge consultation fee added.
  3. Additional prescriptions billed via pharmacy flow.
  4. Invoice generated â†’ payment collected.

---

## 9. **Miscellaneous Billables Flow**

- **Trigger:** Extra services requested (e.g., medical reports).
- **Steps:**

  1. Service logged (documentation, home care, prescription writing).
  2. Fee added to account.
  3. Invoice generated and settled.

---

## 10. **Payment Processing Flow (Cross-Cutting)**

- **Payment Points:**

  - Registration (initial).
  - Lab/diagnostics (before service).
  - Pharmacy (before drug collection).
  - Admission deposit.
  - Surgical pre-payment.
  - Discharge (final bill settlement).

- **Steps:**

  1. Payment request triggered by service.
  2. Cash Office (or POS/online) records payment.
  3. Payment reconciled against invoice.
  4. Receipt generated + audit trail updated.
  5. Account balance adjusted (credit/refund if applicable).

---

## 11. **Back-Office & Audit Flows**

- Daily reconciliation of collected payments vs. services rendered.
- Outstanding bills & credit accounts tracked.
- Automated reports for revenue by department/service.
- Fraud prevention: enforce service release only after payment confirmation.

---

âœ… With these flows, youâ€™d have a **modular billing system** where each hospital department (registration, consultation, labs, pharmacy, inpatient, surgery) plugs into the **central billing engine** and ensures no service slips through without being billed.
