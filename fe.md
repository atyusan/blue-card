Great idea! Let me layout a comprehensive plan for building the hospital billing system frontend. Here's the structured approach:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Frontend Development Plan - Hospital Billing System**

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation**
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Create React + Vite + TypeScript project
   - Install and configure Tailwind CSS
   - Install Material UI (MUI) components
   - Set up project structure and folder organization

2. **Core Dependencies**
   - React Router for navigation
   - Axios for API communication
   - React Query/TanStack Query for state management
   - React Hook Form for form handling
   - Zod for form validation
   - React Hot Toast for notifications

### **Phase 2: Authentication System**
1. **Authentication Context & Hooks**
   - Create AuthContext for global auth state
   - Implement useAuth hook
   - JWT token management (storage, refresh, expiry)
   - Protected route wrapper

2. **Authentication Pages**
   - Login page with form validation
   - Registration page (if needed)
   - Password reset functionality
   - Loading states and error handling

### **Phase 3: Layout & Navigation**
1. **Main Layout Component**
   - Responsive layout with left sidebar
   - Header with user info and logout

   - Advanced filtering and search
   - Export functionality (PDF, Excel)
   - Bulk operations

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Tablet optimization
   - Touch-friendly interactions

### **Phase 6: Integration & Testing**
1. **API Integration**
   - Connect to backend endpoints
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Loading states and skeletons
   - Offline support considerations

2. **Testing & Quality**
   - Unit tests with Vitest
   - Component testing
   - E2E testing with Playwright
   - Accessibility testing

### **Project Structure**
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common/           # Reusable components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout/           # Layout components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ forms/            # Form components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/               # UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/                # Page components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/                # Custom hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ services/             # API services
â”œâ”€â”€ types/                # TypeScript types
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/            # App constants
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/               # Global styles
â””â”€â”€ context/              # React contexts
```

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Material UI
- **State Management**: React Query + Context API
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier

### **Key Features to Implement**
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based auth
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Collapsible sidebar
   - Touch-friendly interface

3. **Performance**
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Optimized re-renders

4. **User Experience**
   - Loading states
   - Error boundaries
   - Toast notifications
   - Smooth transitions

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific phase, or would you prefer to modify this plan first? I can start with the project setup and authentication system, or focus on any particular area you'd like to prioritize.
