## RBAC Protection

### Backend API Protection

All treatment endpoints require specific permissions via `@RequirePermissions()` decorator:

| Endpoint                    | Method            | Permission Required          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `/treatments`               | GET               | `view_treatments`            |
| `/treatments`               | POST              | `create_treatments`          |
| `/treatments/:id`           | GET               | `view_treatments`            |
| `/treatments/:id`           | PATCH             | `update_treatments`          |
| `/treatments/:id`           | DELETE            | `delete_treatments`          |
| `/treatments/:id/status`    | PATCH             | `update_treatment_status`    |
| `/treatments/:id/providers` | POST/DELETE       | `manage_treatment_providers` |
| `/treatments/links`         | POST/PATCH/DELETE | `manage_treatment_links`     |

### Frontend UI Protection

- Edit Treatment: `update_treatments`
- Delete Treatment: `delete_treatments`
- Update Status: `update_treatment_status`

```

## Data Flow

### Creating a Treatment

```
1. User clicks "Start Treatment" on appointment
2. Fills treatment form (title, description, clinical info)
3. Frontend sends CreateTreatmentDto with:
   - patientId (from appointment)
   - primaryProviderId (logged-in user's staff member ID)
   - appointmentId (current appointment)
   - Clinical details
4. Backend validates:
   - Patient exists ✓
   - Primary provider is a service provider ✓
   - Appointment belongs to patient ✓
5. Backend creates treatment + treatment_provider record
6. Backend fetches complete treatment with all relations
7. Frontend receives full treatment data
8. Cache invalidated, query refetches
9. Treatment appears in table immediately
```

### Viewing Treatments

```
1. User navigates to /treatments
2. Query fetches with filters (status, type, priority, appointmentId)
3. Backend returns paginated results
4. Table displays treatments
5. User can click row or menu to view details
6. Details page shows complete treatment information
```
