# RBAC Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation across the hospital management system, covering both backend API protection and frontend UI permission checks.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Controllers Protected with RBAC

#### Treatments Controller (`src/treatments/treatments.controller.ts`)

- ✅ Added `PermissionsGuard` to controller
- ✅ Added permission decorators to all endpoints

**Endpoints Protected:**

- `POST /treatments` → `create_treatments`
- `GET /treatments` → `view_treatments`
- `GET /treatments/:id` → `view_treatments`
- `PATCH /treatments/:id` → `update_treatments`
- `DELETE /treatments/:id` → `delete_treatments`
- `GET /treatments/patient/:patientId/history` → `view_treatments`
- `POST /treatments/:id/providers` → `manage_treatment_providers`
- `DELETE /treatments/:id/providers/:providerId` → `manage_treatment_providers`
- `PATCH /treatments/:id/status` → `update_treatment_status`
- `POST /treatments/links` → `manage_treatment_links`
- `GET /treatments/:id/links` → `view_treatments`
- `GET /treatments/:id/chain` → `view_treatments`
- `PATCH /treatments/links/:linkId` → `manage_treatment_links`
- `DELETE /treatments/links/:linkId` → `manage_treatment_links`

#### Appointments Controller (`src/appointments/appointments.controller.ts`)

- ✅ Added `PermissionsGuard` to controller
- ✅ Added permission decorators to 50+ endpoints

**Key Endpoints Protected:**

- `POST /appointments` → `create_appointments`
- `GET /appointments` → `view_appointments`
- `GET /appointments/:id` → `view_appointments`
- `PATCH /appointments/:id` → `update_appointments`
- `DELETE /appointments/:id` → `cancel_appointments`
- `POST /appointments/reschedule` → `reschedule_appointments`
- `POST /appointments/cancel` → `cancel_appointments`
- `POST /appointments/check-in` → `update_appointments`
- `POST /appointments/complete` → `update_appointments`
- `POST /appointments/payment` → `manage_appointment_payments`
- `POST /appointments/slots` → `manage_appointment_slots`
- `GET /appointments/slots` → `view_appointment_slots`
- `DELETE /appointments/slots/:id` → `delete_appointment_slots`
- `POST /appointments/waitlist` → `manage_appointment_waitlist`
- `POST /appointments/bundles` → `manage_appointment_bundles`
- `GET /appointments/statistics/overview` → `view_appointment_analytics`
- And many more...

### 2. Dynamic Permissions System

#### Database Model

Created `Permission` table with:

- `name` - Permission identifier (e.g., `view_patients`)
- `displayName` - Human-readable name (e.g., "View Patients")
- `description` - Permission description
- `category` - Permission grouping
- `module` - Related system module

#### API Endpoints (`/permissions`)

- `GET /permissions` - Get all permissions grouped by category
- `GET /permissions/categories` - Get all categories
- `GET /permissions/modules` - Get all modules
- `GET /permissions/by-category` - Filter by category
- `GET /permissions/by-module` - Filter by module

#### Seeded Permissions

**76 permissions** across 15 categories:

1. User Management (4)
2. Patient Management (4)
3. Appointment Management (14)
4. Provider Management (5)
5. Treatment Management (7)
6. Consultation Management (3)
7. Laboratory Services (5)
8. Pharmacy Services (4)
9. Surgery Management (3)
10. Billing & Finance (10)
11. Reports & Analytics (3)
12. Role & Permission Management (5)
13. Department Management (4)
14. Service Management (4)
15. System Administration (1)

### 3. Role Permissions Updated

#### Doctor Role (40 permissions)

- Full appointment management (14 permissions)
- Full treatment management (7 permissions)
- Provider management (5 permissions)
- Patient care permissions
- Billing and reporting access

#### Nurse Role (20 permissions)

- View and update appointments
- View treatments and update status
- Provider availability management
- Limited treatment access (no create/delete)

#### Receptionist Role (18 permissions)

- Full appointment scheduling
- Slot and resource management
- Waitlist management
- No treatment access

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Permission Hooks Enhanced

Added to `usePermissions` hook:

**Appointment Permissions:**

- `canViewAppointments()`
- `canCreateAppointments()`
- `canUpdateAppointments()`
- `canCancelAppointments()`
- `canRescheduleAppointments()`
- `canManageAppointmentPayments()`

**Treatment Permissions:**

- `canViewTreatments()`
- `canCreateTreatments()`
- `canUpdateTreatments()`
- `canDeleteTreatments()`
- `canUpdateTreatmentStatus()`
- `canManageTreatmentProviders()`
- `canManageTreatmentLinks()`

### 2. AppointmentsPage Protected

**Actions Protected:**

- ✅ "Create Appointment" button - Only shown if `canCreateAppointments()`
- ✅ "Edit Appointment" menu - Only shown if `canUpdateAppointments()`
- ✅ "Reschedule" menu - Only shown if `canUpdateAppointments()`
- ✅ "Mark Complete" menu - Only shown if `canUpdateAppointments()`
- ✅ "Cancel Appointment" menu - Only shown if `canCancelAppointments()`
- ✅ Page access - Requires `canViewAppointments()`

### 3. AppointmentDetailsPage Protected

**Actions Protected:**

- ✅ "Edit Appointment" button - Only shown if `canUpdateAppointments()`
- ✅ "Cancel Appointment" button - Only shown if `canCancelAppointments()`
- ✅ "Delete Appointment" button - Only shown if `canCancelAppointments()`
- ✅ Action menu (3 dots) - Only shown if user has update or cancel permissions
- ✅ Treatment section - Only shown if `canViewTreatments()`
- ✅ "Start Treatment" button - Only shown if `canCreateTreatments()`
- ✅ "Add Diagnosis" button - Only shown if `canUpdateTreatments()`
- ✅ "Prescribe Medication" button - Only shown if `canUpdateTreatments()`
- ✅ "Request Lab Test" button - Only shown if `canUpdateTreatments()`
- ✅ "Link Treatment" button - Only shown if `canManageTreatmentLinks()`
- ✅ Page access - Requires treatment or appointment permissions

### 4. RolesPage Enhanced

**Dynamic Permissions:**

- ✅ Fetches permissions from API instead of hardcoded constants
- ✅ Shows permission display names (human-readable)
- ✅ Shows permission descriptions for context
- ✅ Automatically groups by category
- ✅ Fixed infinite loop issue with proper useCallback memoization

## Security Benefits

### 1. Defense in Depth

- **Backend**: Guards and decorators prevent unauthorized API access
- **Frontend**: UI conditionally renders based on permissions
- **Database**: Permissions stored in normalized table

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege

- Users only get permissions necessary for their role
- Actions are hidden if user lacks permission
- API calls fail if permission is missing

### 3. Maintainability

- **Single Source of Truth**: Permissions defined in database
- **Dynamic UI**: New permissions automatically appear in role management
- **Consistent**: Same permission names used in backend and frontend

### 4. User Experience

- Users don't see actions they can't perform
- Clear error messages when permission is lacking
- No confusing "Permission Denied" errors after clicking

## Permission Flow

### Backend Flow

```
Request → JwtAuthGuard → PermissionsGuard → @RequirePermissions(['...']) → Controller Method
```

### Frontend Flow

```
User Login → Permissions loaded → usePermissions hook → Conditional rendering
```

## Known Issues

### Resolved

- ✅ Hardcoded permissions (replaced with dynamic API-driven system)

### None Currently

## Future Enhancements

1. **Permission Dependencies**: Define prerequisite permissions

3. **Temporary Permissions**: Time-limited permission grants
4. **Permission Analytics**: Track which permissions are actually used
5. **Custom Permissions**: Allow admins to create new permissions via UI

## Conclusion

The RBAC system is now fully implemented with:

- ✅ Backend API protection via guards and decorators
- ✅ Frontend UI protection via permission hooks
- ✅ Dynamic permission system via database
- ✅ Comprehensive role definitions
- ✅ User-friendly permission management UI

All appointment and treatment actions are now properly protected with granular permissions!
